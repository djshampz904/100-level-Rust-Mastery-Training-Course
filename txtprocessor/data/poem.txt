The sky unfolds in shades of blue,  
A canvas brushed with morning hue.  
Birdsong drifts through waking trees,  
Soft whispers carried on the breeze,  
The world begins its gentle tune.  


Beneath the soil, the roots entwine,  
In silent work, they draw the line.  
Life pulses deep where none can see,  
A quiet strength in mystery,  
The earth prepares its sacred sign.  


The river bends with patient grace,  
Reflecting time upon its face.  
It carves the stone, it feeds the land,  
A force both tender and unplanned,  
Its rhythm sets a steady pace.  


The stars ignite the velvet night,  
Each one a spark of ancient light.  
They speak in silence, bold and far,  
A map of dreams in every star,  
Guiding hearts with quiet might.  


The fire burns with golden glow,  
Its warmth a shield from winds that blow.  
Stories rise in embered air,  
Of love, of loss, of those who dare,  
To chase the light through frost and snow.
